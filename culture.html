    The concept of The Color Runâ„¢ is unique: a colourful 5-km run through the streets of Paris. The goal isn't to win the race but to have as much fun as possible. At each kilometre of the route, the runners are directed towards a 'colour zone' where volunteers throw on them a 100% natural coloured powder made from cornstarch.

<p> The purpose of Color Run? The color run also know as the happiest 5k on the planet   </p>
<p> Does Color Run wash out?, Well all the love colors but sadly our color is designed to wash out to keep u looking fresh </p>
